Description: adds a new button near map adventure minimap, which will open a search selection dialog. After selecting the object you look for, press "F" key to display all objects of that type/subtype. Each key press will display next object, so you can check for additional infos in map. Once all objects all that type&subtype are looped, you will get a "loop end" message and will restart from first. In dialog you also haved a on/off button which will switch between "show ALL objects on map" or not. If you choose to see all objects while you did not visit all areas, loop will remove fog of war around the objects selected.

Custom Search icon will allow you to enter the type and subtype you desire.
